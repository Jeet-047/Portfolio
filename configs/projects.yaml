    full_desc: >
      This project implements a real-world, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
      question-answering system designed to efficiently answer questions from large document collections. 
      The system first ingests documents from multiple sources such as PDFs, Word files, text files, and URLs, 
      extracts both text and metadata, and cleans the content in a structured manner. The cleaned data is then 
      split into meaningful chunks, converted into vector embeddings, and stored for fast retrieval. 
      When a user asks a question, the system intelligently retrieves the most relevant document chunks 
      using similarity search, improves accuracy through re-ranking and diversity optimization, and builds 
      a focused context for the language model. Depending on the context size, it dynamically applies 
      either a simple or map-reduce strategy before generating the final answer using fast, locally running 
      LLMs. The result is a system that balances accuracy, speed, scalability, and simplicity, making it 
      suitable for document Q&A, internal knowledge bases, research assistants, and enterprise-level document 
      search—without relying on costly external APIs.

      This project demonstrates a CNN-based approach for categorizing and detecting brain tumors. 
      The dataset utilized in this study comprises four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, 
      and no tumor in a total of 7023 MRI images. In this project, the combination of a pre-trained 
      model (VGG16) and fine-tuning works very accurately to classify the malignant tumor. 
      However, there are three fully connected layers 256, 128, and 64 with dropout and batch normalization 
      respectively, which enhances the overall validation accuracy of 98.67%, and also improves the precision, 
      sensitivity, and specificity rather than commonly used convolutional neural network models (CNNs).

    full_desc: >
      Developed a computer vision system that automatically detects and classifies person entry and 
      exit events from CCTV video using object detection and appearance-based re-identification. 
      The pipeline uses a YOLO-based person detector and a FusionReID (ResNet-50) model to extract 
      robust body embeddings. When a person interacts with a predefined door zone, their appearance 
      embedding is compared with embeddings from recent frames using cosine similarity to determine 
      identity continuity and movement direction. This enables single-camera, online person 
      re-identification for accurate entry/exit analytics while preserving identity privacy.

    full_desc: >
      In this research, we proposed a novel method for predicting Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection using machine learning techniques.
      This study suggests a prediction framework for the Hepatitis C virus that is based on machine learning techniques. In this dataset 564 patients with 12 distinct features are present. 
      We tested two cases, the first one without feature selection and with feature selection based on Gain Ratio Attribute Evaluation (GRAE) to guarantee the strength and dependability of the suggested framework.
      We evaluated various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting, to determine their effectiveness in predicting HCV infection based on the selected features. 
      The results demonstrated that our approach significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, highlighting the potential of machine learning in enhancing early diagnosis and treatment of HCV.
